    content: |-
      I am a Regional Cloud Advocate focusing on building out and skilling communities in the Pacific North West, with a focus on the Microsoft Reactor in Redmond, Washington, as well as a passion for the internet of things, edge computing and TinyML. I'm British, so I sound way smarter than I actually am.
      
      In the past I've lived in 4 continents working as a developer in the mobile, desktop, and scientific space. I've spoken at conferences and events all around the globe, organised meetup groups and communities, and written a book on mobile development.

      I also hate and am allergic to cats, but I have a 9-year-old daughter who loves cats, so I have 2 cats.

        description: In this show Jim looks at Custom Vision object detection. The custom vision service recently has been updated to include object detection, and this allows you to train the service to detect multiple objects inside an image with their locations, instead of just being a simple classifier. Jim walks through creating an object detection model, tagging regions in images that show the objects to be detected, then he builds a simple Xamarin app to use this to annotate a picture from his daughters toybox, naming all the toys it finds.

            description: Jim left the UK a few years ago to move to the Pacific North West of the US. Back in the UK the scariest animal he might have encountered would be a sudden hedgehog, but in Washington State where he lives it seems there are bears! He even lost an apple tree and a fence to one once. A useful tool for him would be a bear detector – a device to alert him if there are bears in the garden.
